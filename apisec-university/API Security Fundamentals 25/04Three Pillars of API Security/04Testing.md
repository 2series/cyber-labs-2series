### Training

Under-Testing of APIs:

A survey showed only 4% of organizations conduct security testing on their APIs.
Emphasis on the need for both positive and negative testing.

Categories of Testing:

Security Testing: Identifying unsecured endpoints, vulnerabilities like injection flaws, and improper access controls.
Data Testing: Assessing what data APIs access and return, ensuring sensitive data is handled appropriately.
Logic Testing: Identifying unique vulnerabilities, such as broken object-level authorization (BOLA) and object ID manipulation.

Testing Challenges:

Difficulty in covering diverse testing scenarios efficiently.
Need for continuous testing rather than sporadic assessments.
Integration and automation of testing processes into the development cycle.

Common Approaches to API Security Testing:

Do Nothing: A common but ineffective approach where organizations ignore API vulnerabilities.
Do It Yourself: Utilizing tools like Postman, Burp, and Zap, requiring significant expertise and time.
Third-Party Pen Testing: Engaging external security firms, which can be infrequent and may not cover all APIs.

Proposed Solution:

Automated API Security Testing: APIsecâ€™s automated scanner creates and runs numerous attack simulations covering OWASP categories with minimal time and expertise needed from the user.
Integration into CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing to identify issues before deployment.

Call to Action:

Need for improved API testing practices to enhance security and mitigate vulnerabilities.

Overall, the page stresses the critical need for enhanced API security testing methods and the solutions available through APIsec's automated tools.
