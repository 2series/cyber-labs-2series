## Web Hacking: The Unseen Threat

### The Dark Reality of Web Hacking
Web hacking is one of the most insidious attack vectors on the internet today, with hackers exploiting vulnerabilities to steal millions of user accounts, passwords, credit card information, and even social security numbers. But how do they manage to breach these seemingly secure systems?

### The Weak Link: SQL Databases and Web Servers
The answer lies in the way many websites, including giants like Facebook, Google, and Amazon, store user information in SQL databases connected to web servers. These servers process user transactions, login requests, and other critical functions, making them a prime target for malicious attackers. A single coding mistake can be catastrophic, allowing hackers to inject SQL code or special characters into forms or URLs, compromising the entire system


### The Heroes of Cybersecurity: White Hat Hackers
To combat these threats, White Hat Hackers (Penetration Testers) must be well-versed in multiple disciplines, including web hacking and secure coding. By mastering these skills, they can identify web vulnerabilities and coding exploits that could lead to devastating attacks. Armed with this knowledge, they provide companies with critical information on how to secure their code and websites, preventing potential breaches


### Enter Natas: The Web Security Challenge
Natas, a web security challenge hosted on OverTheWire, is designed to teach the basics of server-side web security. This interactive platform covers a range of topics, including:

- Replay Attacks
- Header Manipulation
- Directory Traversal
- And more

### The Natas Challenge: Level Up Your Skills
Each level of Natas consists of its own website, [located at](http://natasX.natas.labs.overthewire.org), where X is the level number. The goal is to obtain the password for the next level, which is stored in /etc/natas_webpass/. With each level, you'll face new challenges and opportunities to hone your skills in web security

There is no SSH login. To access a level, enter the username for that level (e.g. natas0 for level 0) and its password.

Each level has access to the password of the next level. Our job is to somehow obtain that next password and level up. All passwords are also stored in /etc/natas_webpass/. E.g. the password for natas5 is stored in the file /etc/natas_webpass/natas5 and only readable by natas4 and natas5.

## Are You Ready to Take the Challenge?
Let's begin our journey through Natas and discover the world of web security. With each level, we'll learn new techniques and strategies to stay ahead of malicious hackers. The challenge is on â€“ are you ready to level up your skills and become a web security expert?
