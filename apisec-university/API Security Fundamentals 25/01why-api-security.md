What are APIs?

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the communication methods used by software to interact, often described as "websites for machines."
They enable seamless communication across platforms and services (e.g., Google with Lyft, Venmo with banks, airfare searches on Kayak).
API Usage and Traffic

APIs power about 83% of internet traffic (Akamai study).
APIs are integral to websites, mobile apps, and various online services.
API Security Landscape

API attacks have become the most frequent attack vector (Gartner Group).
Only 4% of API testing focuses on security, while 96% focuses on functionality (RapidAPI survey), highlighting a security gap.
What Makes APIs Attractive Targets?

APIs connect to sensitive data and systems: personal info, credit card data, transaction engines.
Attackers seek to steal data, commit fraud, scrape data.
APIs serve as the “glue” between external users and internal systems.
Many APIs are over-permissioned, exposing more data/functionality than necessary.
API flaws and logic errors can lead to vulnerabilities exploitable by attackers.
APIs Are Not Hidden

APIs can be easily discovered by inspecting network traffic on websites or apps.
Attackers probe these APIs by monitoring traffic and directly sending crafted API requests bypassing UI controls.
API Attack Simplicity

Traditional cyberattacks have complex kill chains; API attacks often require less sophistication by directly exploiting vulnerabilities.
Attackers can bypass UI restrictions and access powerful API calls.
Regulatory and Compliance Context

Multiple regulatory bodies pay attention to API security due to data breaches through APIs:
Examples: T-Mobile breach exposing 37 million records via API.
Verizon fined $16M by FCC related to API data leaks; mandated continuous API security testing.
Regulations involving APIs:
PCI DSS 4.0 requiring checks for API abuse and developer training.
GDPR, HIPAA, and other privacy laws regulate APIs handling personal/health information.
SEC requires breach notifications and disclosure of API risks.
FedRAMP requires monthly cloud service security testing including APIs.
UN cyber requirements for connected vehicles, powered by APIs.
Core Regulatory Themes

Security: APIs must be configured and operated securely.
Privacy: APIs accessing personal data must protect privacy.
Data Accessibility: Many regulations mandate APIs for data portability and integration but require secure data transfers.
Summary

APIs are critical, widespread, and vulnerable components of modern digital services.
Attackers frequently target APIs because of large attack surface and often poor security focus.
Organizations must prioritize API security, continuous testing, and compliance with evolving regulations.
