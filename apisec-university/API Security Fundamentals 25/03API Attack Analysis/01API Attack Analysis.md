### API Attack Analysis

Analysis of common API breaches reveals top attack patterns behind most threats.

Rate limiting is involved in nearly 70% of attacks and is a defense mechanism against high volume brute force and bot attacks but is not foolproof.

Attackers can bypass rate limiting by:

Discovering and slightly reducing request rates below thresholds.
Distributing attacks across thousands of IPs using proxies.
Rate limiting alone cannot prevent data breaches because attackers invest time to exfiltrate data.

The core causes of most API breaches (90%) align with OWASP top 3 API security risks:

Broken Authorization: unauthorized access to other users' data.
Broken Authentication: unsecured APIs allowing unrestricted access.
Excess Data Exposure: APIs returning more data than necessary, especially sensitive information.
Addressing OWASP top 3 risks significantly improves API security.

Training and awareness should be provided not only to security teams but also to developers to help identify and fix vulnerable code early.
