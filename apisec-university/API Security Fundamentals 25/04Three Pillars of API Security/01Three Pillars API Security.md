### Governance



Governance: Involves defining, establishing, and enforcing standard processes for the development, testing, and secure production of APIs.
Monitoring: Focuses on runtime protection of APIs in production, ensuring they behave correctly and are free from attacks or anomalous activity.
Testing: Ensures APIs are free of vulnerabilities and function as intended, preventing exploitable flaws.

Objective: Understanding risks and implementing strategies to secure APIs effectively.
