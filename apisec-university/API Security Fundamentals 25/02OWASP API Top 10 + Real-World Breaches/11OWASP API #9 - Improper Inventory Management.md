## OWASP API #9: Improper Inventory Management

Improper Inventory Management is #9 in the 2023 OWASP API Top 10, but is a common and critical issue.

It involves two main aspects:
Awareness and visibility of all APIs running in your environment.
Control over those APIs (whether they should run, are up to date, retired, documented, and secure).

Problems include:
Zombie or shadow APIs: APIs running without awareness.
Outdated API versions still accessible.
Version control issues allowing attackers to access older, less secure versions.

Example breach: Optus (Australian telco) API breach exposing 9.8 million subscriber records due to:
Publicly accessible API with no authentication.
API exposing sensitive PII (driverâ€™s license numbers, phone numbers, DOB, addresses).
Use of incremental IDs aiding mass data harvesting.
The breach highlighted the risks of unknown APIs and lack of governance.

Recommendations:
Establish a cross-functional team (security, development, operations, compliance, risk) for API governance.
Define and enforce standardized API deployment policies and processes.

Maintain a comprehensive inventory of APIs using multiple discovery methods:
Traffic-based discovery (e.g., leveraging WAF tools).
Code-based discovery (scanning code repositories).
App crawling discovery.
Dictionary/brute force discovery.
Direct communication with engineering teams for insight.
Use a common API gateway to centralize visibility, policy enforcement, and management.
Properly retire deprecated APIs and ensure clients/partners upgrade to supported versions.
Conduct periodic audits to verify access rights and remove unnecessary access.
