## OWASP API Security Top 10 - Risk Module

OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project) is a non-profit organization known for its guidance on application security, particularly the OWASP Top 10 for Web Applications.

In 2019, OWASP recognized that APIs have unique security risks and developed a separate API Security Top 10 list.

The API Security Top 10 was updated in 2023 with some additions, changes, and deletions; this course covers the 2023 edition.

The course format will break down each of the Top 10 risks into submodules with explanations, examples, risk demonstrations, and best practices.

There has been a large volume of successful API attacks and breaches in the real world, despite companies employing best security practices like web application firewalls, source code scanning, dynamic testing, and penetration testing.

Real-world attacks include unauthorized trading, account data harvesting, data exposure, takeovers, tampering, reputation risk, ransom, and third-party exposure.

These attacks show that existing defenses are often insufficient to stop API-specific threats.

The course will start by exploring the first OWASP API Security Top 10 risk in detail.
