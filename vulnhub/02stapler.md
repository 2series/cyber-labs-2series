# Stapler: 1 - VulnHub Challenge Walkthrough

## Overview
Stapler: 1 is a beginner to intermediate level boot2root challenge designed to help security enthusiasts learn and practice penetration testing skills. This challenge focuses on common web vulnerabilities, privilege escalation techniques, and basic system enumeration.

## Challenge Details
- **Name**: Stapler: 1
- **Author**: g0tmi1k
- **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate
- **Release Date**: 2016
- **Download**: [VulnHub - Stapler: 1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/stapler-1,150/)

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:
- Oracle VirtualBox or VMware
- Kali Linux VM
- Basic understanding of Linux commands
- Familiarity with penetration testing tools

## Setup Instructions
1. Download the Stapler: 1 VM from VulnHub
2. Import the VM into your virtualization software
3. Configure the network adapter to Host-only or NAT network
4. Start both your Kali Linux and the Stapler VM

## Getting Started

### Initial Enumeration
1. First, locate the target IP address:
```bash
sudo netdiscover -r 192.168.56.0/24
```

2. Perform a comprehensive port scan:
```bash
nmap -sC -sV -p- -oN stapler_scan.txt <target_ip>
```

### Web Application Analysis
1. Enumerate web services:
```bash
nikto -h http://<target_ip>
```

2. Directory enumeration:
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://<target_ip> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```

## Service Enumeration
- Check all open ports identified by Nmap
- Look for:
  * Default credentials
  * Misconfigured services
  * Outdated software versions

## Exploitation Path
1. Identify vulnerable services
2. Attempt initial access
3. Establish foothold
4. Perform privilege escalation

## Important Notes
- Take detailed notes during enumeration
- Create regular backups of the target VM
- Some services might require multiple attempts to exploit
- Document all successful and failed attempts

- Check for common misconfigurations
- Look for unusual services or ports
- Document your progress
- Try multiple approaches before moving to hints

## Conclusion
Stapler: 1 provides an excellent platform for practicing various penetration testing techniques. Remember to approach the challenge methodically and document your findings. The key to success is thorough enumeration and persistence.
