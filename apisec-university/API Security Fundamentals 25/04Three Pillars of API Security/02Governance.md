### Governance

Two Core Components of Governance

Awareness:

Maintain visibility of all APIs, their infrastructure, risks, and ownership.
Conduct a comprehensive inventory of APIs, including their functions and interconnections.

Policy and Process:

Standardize deployment processes for API approval and validation to avoid unauthorized (rogue) APIs.
Use an API gateway to manage and validate API traffic.

Importance of Documentation
Mandatory Documentation: Essential for internal and external users.
Common Format: OpenAPI Specification (OAS), formerly known as Swagger, is the industry standard for REST API documentation.
Publishing Control: Ensure access control for sensitive API documentation to mitigate risks.

Documentation Content
Should include:
Functionality of endpoints, descriptions, base URLs, authentication requirements, parameters, and methods.
Automation: Generate documentation automatically to keep it up-to-date.

API Style Guide
Establish a style guide defining:
Authentication and authorization practices.
Naming conventions, including nouns for URLs and verbs for methods.
Definition of error codes and versioning standards.
Example of Good Practices
Reference to Atlassian's API documentation and style guide, showcasing clear definitions for authentication and versioning protocols.

By adhering to these key points, organizations can improve their API security governance and ensure a consistent, secure approach to API management.
